# 🎓 Admissions Funnel Simulator

> An interactive, browser-based tool that reverse-engineers your enrollment pipeline — from enrollment goal to top-of-funnel inquiry need — using configurable yield rates and what-if analysis.

## Why this exists

Every admissions team talks about enrollment funnels. Almost no one has a fast, interactive way to answer the question:

> *"If I want to enroll 400 students and my deposit yield drops 5%, how many more inquiries do I need?"*

This tool answers that question in real time — no spreadsheet, no SQL, no waiting on a report.

---

## Features

- **Enrollment goal input** — set your target class size and the entire funnel recalculates instantly
- **4 configurable yield rates** — Inquiry → App → Admit → Deposit → Enroll
- **What-if mode** — adjust a scenario in parallel and see exactly how each stage shifts (green/red delta badges)
- **College presets** — one-click benchmarks for Small Liberal Arts, Mid-size University, Highly Selective, and Transfer-heavy institutions
- **Insight summary** — auto-generated plain-English takeaway identifying your bottleneck stage
- **Bar chart** — visual breakdown with overlay in what-if mode
- **No backend, no login, no data leaves your browser** — pure HTML/CSS/JS

## How to use

### Step 1 — Set your enrollment goal
Type your target class size in the **Enrollment goal** box (top-right corner). The entire funnel recalculates from this number instantly.

> Example: Enter `400` to model a class of 400 enrolled students.

### Step 2 — Choose a preset (optional)
Click any preset button to load realistic benchmark yield rates for your institution type. Great for quick exploration before dialing in your real numbers.

### Step 3 — Drag the yield rate sliders
Each slider controls the conversion rate between stages. Drag left to lower, right to raise — all numbers update in real time.

- **Inquiry → Application** — what % of inquiries submit an application
- **Application → Admit** — your admit/acceptance rate
- **Admit → Deposit** — yield rate (how many admitted students commit)
- **Deposit → Enroll** — how many deposited students actually show up

> Tip: Use your institution's actual historical rates for the most accurate pipeline estimate.

### Step 4 — Read the pipeline results
The right panel shows exactly how many students you need at each stage to hit your goal. The insight box at the bottom auto-identifies your tightest conversion stage.

### Step 5 — Run a what-if scenario
Click **What-if mode** at the top. A second set of sliders appears. Adjust any rate to model a change — each funnel stage shows a green/red delta badge vs your base scenario.

> Try this: Lower "Admit → Deposit" by 5% to see how many more inquiries you'd need to compensate.

### Step 6 — Read the delta badges
- 🟢 Green = more students needed at that stage in the what-if scenario
- 🔴 Red = fewer students needed (yield improved)

> **Pro tip:** Run this before your enrollment committee meeting. Model a 3–5% yield drop and walk in knowing exactly how many additional inquiries your team needs to stay on goal.
